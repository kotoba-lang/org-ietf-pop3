;; `kotoba/pop3/session.kotoba` against `pop3.client`.
;;
;; The slice is opening a maildrop and listing it: greeting, CAPA, the
;; strongest authentication the server advertised, STAT, LIST, UIDL, QUIT.
;; The guest is an application — state in, one reply line in, next state and
;; one inert effect out — so the oracle and the guest are driven by the SAME
;; script and compared on what went on the wire, what the drop reported, what
;; the listing joined to, and what a failure says.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph). Nothing but this file notices the two drifting apart.
;;
;; ## What is compared, and what deliberately is not
;;
;; The guest never receives a credential (see the module header): `init` is
;; told *whether* a password exists, never what it is. So where the oracle
;; writes `PASS secret\r\n` the guest emits `:credential/pass` and an empty
;; line. Comparing those literally would assert the very thing this design
;; removes, so `normalise` maps BOTH sides onto the same tags. It is
;; deliberately the only place the two effect representations meet, and it
;; recognises POP3 verbs by an explicit list rather than by a shape — a
;; regex over "looks like a command" would silently reclassify a base64
;; payload that happened to start with four capitals.
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;; Four, because these are the rules a careless port loses while every
;; in-order happy-path script still passes:
;;
;;   * `capa-err-is-not-a-failure` — RFC 2449;
;;   * `absent-uidl-is-an-absent-uid-not-a-failed-listing` — RFC 1939 §7;
;;   * `listing-must-join-list-and-uidl-on-the-number` — the join, checked by
;;     scripting UIDL in a DIFFERENT order from LIST. A port that zips the
;;     two listings positionally passes every in-order script and is wrong;
;;   * `a-stuffed-line-loses-exactly-one-dot` — RFC 1939 §3.
;;
;; ## JVM
;;
;; This runs the guest in-process through the KIR interpreter, which is the
;; shape `org-ietf-smtp` established and the only oracle-parity route that
;; exists today. Per Q9 (`:oracle-parity {:jvm-required false …
;; :jvm-observations :historical-non-gating}`) a JVM run is NOT the JVM-free
;; evidence for this migration. That evidence is the pair recorded in the
;; module header and reproducible without a JDK:
;;
;;   amu check   kotoba/pop3/session.kotoba --jvm-free            -> :ok true
;;   amu compile kotoba/pop3/session.kotoba --jvm-free \
;;     --target wasm32-browser                       -> 12554-byte .wasm
;;
;; (Measured 2026-08-30 on amu 88ae83e. An observation of one build, not a
;; contract — re-measure rather than quoting it.)
