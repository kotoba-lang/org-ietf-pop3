(ns pop3.client
  "POP3 (RFC 1939) session driver over a `pop3.transport/Transport`.

  `pop3.protocol` supplies the pure command/response functions; this
  namespace is the stateful loop that reads a status line and, for the
  multi-line commands, keeps reading until the `.` terminator.

  ## The shape of a POP3 session, and the trap in it

  POP3 has no folders, no flags and no server-side state worth the name.
  A session opens, locks the maildrop, hands over messages by *number*,
  and those numbers are assigned fresh each session and renumber the
  moment anything is deleted. The only identifier that survives is the
  UIDL (§7), which is why `list-messages!` returns it alongside the
  number and why a caller that wants to know what it has already seen
  must key on the UID and never on the number.

  The other trap is DELE. `retrieve!` does not delete, and nothing here
  deletes implicitly — a mail client that removes the server's only copy
  as a side effect of reading it has destroyed the mailbox for every
  other client the account is opened in. `delete!` exists and says so."
