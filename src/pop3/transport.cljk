(ns pop3.transport
  "The wire boundary for POP3 (RFC 1939): a 3-fn `Transport` protocol
  (write!/read-line!/close!) that `pop3.client` drives and every other
  namespace in this library is blind to. The real transport
  (`tls-connect`) is JVM-only (a raw `SSLSocket`, implicit TLS on port
  995 -- POP3S); tests inject a fake in-memory `Transport` instead.

  Deliberately not shared code with `org-ietf-smtp`'s and
  `org-ietf-imap`'s identically-shaped transports -- same structural
  idea, three different protocols, kept independent per this org's
  grab-bag-library convention.

  ## Reads are binary strings, not UTF-8

  Everything read off the wire is decoded **ISO-8859-1**, one byte per
  character, so character *n* is byte *n*. That is the input contract
  `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-mime` states, and RETR hands its result straight
  to that library.

  A message is bytes, and its parts routinely disagree about what those
  bytes mean -- a UTF-8 body beside an ISO-2022-JP subject beside a PDF.
  Decoding the whole thing as UTF-8 destroys every part that was not
  UTF-8, and does it quietly: the result is U+FFFD, not an error.
  `org-ietf-imap` shipped one commit with a UTF-8-reading transport and
  the symptom was a Japanese body arriving as mojibake that looked like a
  bug in the MIME parser.

  Command *writes* stay UTF-8, because a command is text this library
  composed rather than bytes it received.")
