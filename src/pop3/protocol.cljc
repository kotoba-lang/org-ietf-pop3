(ns pop3.protocol
  "Pure POP3 (RFC 1939) command construction and response parsing -- no
  I/O here. `pop3.transport` is the wire, `pop3.client` drives the
  request/response loop; this namespace only turns data into command
  strings and turns response lines back into data, so it is testable
  without a socket at all.

  Also covers the extensions a real deployment needs: CAPA (RFC 2449),
  STLS (RFC 2595), APOP (RFC 1939 §7) and SASL AUTH (RFC 5034).

  **Messages are not parsed here.** RETR and TOP return the bytes the
  server sent, and `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-mime` turns those into headers,
  parts, attachments and decoded text. Wire protocol is this library's
  subject; message format is that one's."
